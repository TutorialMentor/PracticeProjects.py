Apply your Py knowledge to practices from no experience to everything

You know that feeling? When you learn something new you want to apply it to practice use otherwise you'll just forget it? That's me. Py being my first computer language was a little bit confusing. Not as in I didn't know how to code, I always understood the logic and how to apply the concepts. But I didn't know where and when. 

That's what this project is about. Whether you know nothing at all or you've learned quite a lot. In this project there will be a number of projects for every concept, yes EVERY concept. Now if you know print and input, you can't just make a calculator out of it. Meaning, the less the concepts the more limitations to what we can do. But as you progress up, you'll get more of those cool stuff. And hey, for your learning and improvement purposes if you're new to Py, only apply concepts that the project will ask you to. Every project file will include a file dalles "requirement" explaining what concept are uses in each projects. Or feel free to skip the concepts...

If you're already learning from somwhere else there may be concepts you may have not learned yet based on project's. So if you want to follow the order of project, then shout-out to BroCode's playlist I've learned Py from: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOOkUQbat8LyQii36cJf2SWT&si=aYHvjVFSTQe9JnK4

I hope you learn, improve, and enjoy. Good luck!
